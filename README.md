- The name of this project is colorGenerator.
- Every time you click the bordered text on the screen, the background color will be randomly changed and Hexadecimal color name will be displayed above the initial text.
- The project was made using JavaScript programming language. Besides JavaScript, i used HTML (for structure) - in this case for wrapper and bit of CSS (for styling).
- This project is yet another one with which i practiced my JavaScript knowledge.
